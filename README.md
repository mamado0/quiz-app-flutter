# fav_app
A new Flutter project.
In this app which is build by flutter, here I used Stateful and Stateless widgets.
Visible(Input/Output) and Invisible(Layout/Control). 
Complex with lots of config options(eg. MaterialApp) and simpler(eg. Text). 
Styling, and Positioning via code in the widget tree.
Widgets can work together to achieve a certain look and structure
